# firebase_spike
a spike/sandbox to explore firebase and work out how to test apps written with it

Two servers need to run for testing: the Selenium webdriver (`webdriver-manager start`) and node's http-server (`http-server`).

Protractor tests are run with `protractor test/features/conf.js`

See Wiki for:

- installing Protractor
- getting Protractor to work with non-Angular pages
